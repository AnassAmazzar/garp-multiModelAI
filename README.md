A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Voici une suggestion de description que vous pouvez ajouter dans le fichier README.md de votre projet :

MultiModelAI
MultiModelAI is an advanced AI project designed to showcase multiple deep learning techniques for a variety of tasks, including image classification, stock market prediction, and chatbot functionality. The project leverages different neural network architectures to address real-world problems efficiently and effectively.

Features
1. Image Classification (ANN)
Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the classification of images based on predefined categories. This model serves as a basic approach for image recognition tasks.
2. Image Classification (CNN)
A more advanced image classification model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which is better suited for handling complex image data and achieving higher accuracy in tasks like object detection and recognition.
3. Stock Market Prediction (RNN)
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model designed to predict stock market trends and future prices based on historical data, helping to provide insights into financial forecasting.
4. Chatbot
An AI-driven chatbot capable of answering user queries based on pre-trained models. The chatbot uses NLP techniques to understand and respond to text inputs.
